	<h1>Self-Care Assessment Quiz</h1>
	<p>The following is a basic quiz for assessing one's self-care practices. This quiz is not exhaustive, merely suggestive. When you are finished, look for patterns in your responses. Are you more active in some areas of self-care? Do you tend to ignore others? Are there items on the list that hadn't even occurred to you? Listen to your internal responses and dialogue about self-care, and take note of anything you would like to prioritize moving forward. [todo reword]</p>
